# 📋 Project Requirements  

## Project Overview  

This graduation project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based inventory management system that enables businesses to efficiently track and manage their inventory. The system provides real-time monitoring of stock levels, streamlines product and supplier management, and offers intelligent alerts to prevent stockouts.  

Small to medium-sized businesses often struggle with inventory management using manual processes or disconnected systems. This solution addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform that reduces administrative overhead, minimizes stockouts, and improves overall inventory visibility.  

Additionally, the system will include a simplified sales module with invoice generation and return processing capabilities, allowing businesses to manage direct sales operations alongside inventory tracking.
